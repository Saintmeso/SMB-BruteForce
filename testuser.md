# Test User Creation

To fully test that the bruteforce attack was working, I used the Command Prompt to create a test user named "testuser2" with the password of "Kali" (Which is already one of the potential passwords in the passlist) to see if it will execute correctly and find the password.

I used the "command "net user testuser2 kali /add"
